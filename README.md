# No Money - No Books (OpenMW)

To be able to read other people's books, you actually need to buy them. Or steal.

Because barging into Jobasha's shop, reading 10 skill books, and never paying him is wrong - and also cheesy. Now you'll have an actual reason to buy books for yourself too.

## Features

### Shops Are Not Libraries

You are restricted from reading displayed books before buying them first. A book is considered "buyable" if it meets these criteria:

- It is owned
- Its owner sells books
- Book's owner is active (in the same interior or exterior as the book)

## Requirements

OpenMW, duh.

## Installation

Install like any other OpenMW mod.

## Compatibility

Might conflict with other mods that alter owned book activation (similar to this mod).

Confirmed to be compatible:

- [OpenMW Animated Pickup and Shop Around](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/54585) by **taitechnic** - Doesn't affect books
- [Book Pickup](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46625) by **NullCascade and Zackhasacat** - Alters only unowned books

## Known Issues

Since you can no longer open buyable books, to steal them you'll need to do it from the open inventory using the cursor.  
Yes, this is intended.  
No, it will not be changed (sneak status is not exposed to the Lua API yet).

## Other Mods to Enhance Your Reading Experience

- [trav's OpenMW Books Enhanced](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/55126) by **trav** - Replaces the book/scroll in-game UI with a custom one mimicking the vanilla look, but with additional features like adjustable size.
- [Book Pickup](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46625) by **NullCascade and Zackhasacat** - Lets you pick up a book without opening it first
